    "\n",
    "A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) involves finding a solution that satisfies a number of constraints or conditions. It is widely used in fields like artificial intelligence for scheduling, assigning, and planning problems. CSPs typically involve variables, domains for each variable, and constraints that describe allowable combinations of values. The goal is to assign values to all variables in a way that doesn't violate any constraints (Russell & Norvig, 2010, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach). This framework is particularly effective in scenarios like employee scheduling, where multiple conditions must be met simultaneously.\n",

    "- _'people_abilities'_: A dictionary where keys are candidate names and values are sets of their skills. It represents the pool of potential hires.\n",
    "- _'roles_needed'_: A dictionary outlining the number of each type of skill required. It's adjusted to account for Ciara's Python skill.\n",
    "- _'get_all_valid_combinations'_: A function that iterates through all possible combinations of three candidates using itertools.combinations. It checks if a combination covers all roles by comparing the sum of their skills against roles_needed.\n",
    "- _'valid_combinations'_: This is where the function stores each successful combination that meets the criteria, alongside the specific roles each person would fill."
