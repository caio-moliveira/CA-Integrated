    "  - _Description_: A set of individuals who are pre-selected for the team due to their specific skills or other constraints. For instance, Ciara is always selected for her Python skill.\n",
    "  - _Operation_: The script adjusts the `variables_domain` and `constraint` based on the skills of these pre-selected individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing pre-selected individuals**:\n",
    "  - _Process_: The script iteratively removes pre-selected individuals from the `variables_domain` and adjusts the `constraint_2` accordingly to reflect their contribution to the required skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`meets_requirements` function**: \n",
    "  - _Description_: A function that checks if a particular combination of people meets the required skills. It tallies the skills of the combination and compares this against the `constraint` to determine if it's a valid team setup.\n",
    "  - _Process_: \n",
    "    1. Initialize a count for each required skill.\n",
    "    2. Tally the skills for each individual in the combination.\n",
    "    3. Compare the tally against the requirements in `constraint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generating Possible Teams**:\n",
    "  - _Description_: The script generates all combinations of 1 to 4 people from the remaining candidates (not including pre-selected ones) and checks each combination to see if it meets the required skills.\n",
    "  - _Storage_: Valid combinations that meet all requirements are stored in `possible_teams`, each including the pre-selected individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`possible_teams`**:\n",
    "  - _Description_: A list that stores each team combination that successfully covers all the required skills. Each team includes the pre-selected individuals along with the combination of other candidates that, together, fulfill all role requirements.\n"

    "### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) involves finding a solution that satisfies a number of constraints or conditions. It is widely used in fields like artificial intelligence for scheduling, assigning, and planning problems. CSPs typically involve variables, domains for each variable, and constraints that describe allowable combinations of values. The goal is to assign values to all variables in a way that doesn't violate any constraints (Russell & Norvig, 2010). This framework is particularly effective in scenarios like employee scheduling, where multiple conditions must be met simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- _A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is typically defined by three fundamental components:_ (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " A more efficient method uses the backtracking paradigm (BT) that is the most common algorithm for performing\n",
    "systematic search. Backtracking incrementally attempts to extend a partial solution toward a\n",
    "complete solution, by repeatedly choosing a value for another variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking paradigm carefully builds a solution to a problem by testing using many options and discarding those that don't work. It attempts to gradually expand the partial solution that it begins with. It selects a variable and gives it a consistent value at each step, while at the same time ensuring that the current sequence of assignments doesn't violate any constraints. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm doesn't proceed further down that path and instead goes back (or \"backtracks\") to the previous step to try a different value or path. (Barták, Morris, & Venable, 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue with most backtracking-based systematic search algorithms is that there are a lot of \"backtracks\" to other options, which reduces system efficiency. There are specific situations where it is feasible to fully remove the necessity for going back. Additionally, there are methods that select a unique variable ordering to minimize the amount of backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables (X):**\n",
    "   - Each potencial person: Peter, Juan, Jim, Jane, Mary, Bruce, Anita and Ciara).\n",
    "   - Each variable can take on values from a domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Domains (D):**\n",
    "   - Each domain is a set of possible values that its corresponding variable can assume. In this case, the abilities each person (Variables) has. \n",
    "   - Domains can be finite or infinite, depending on the specific CSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constraints (C):**\n",
    "   - Each constraint involves some subset of the variables and specifies the allowable combinations of values those variables can take. Constraints can be represented in various ways, including explicit lists of allowable combinations (extensional constraints) or more general mathematical relations or logical propositions (intensional constraints).\n",
    "   \n",
    " - **Scenario 1:**\n",
    "   1. There must be 2 Python Programmers, 2 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer;\n",
    "   2. Ciara knows Python, so 1 Python role is taken (remaining 1);\n",
    "   3. The company can hire only 3 people to fill the rest of the roles. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Scenario 2:**\n",
    "   1. There must be 2 Python Programmers, 3 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer;\n",
    "   2. This time, Juan and Ciara have to be on the list of hired people with their respective abilities.\n",
    "   3. The company can hire max of 4 people for the rest of the roles.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of a CSP is to find an assignment of values to variables that satisfies all constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CSP algorithm would try different combinations of the candidates, assigning them to various roles while ensuring all constraints are met.\n",
    "- A solution to the CSP is an assignment of values to all variables that does not violate any constraints. Depending on the problem, there might be none, one, or many possible solutions. \n",
    "- It uses backtracking to explore all possible configurations going backwards and checking if any constraint is violated.\n",
    "- Scenario 1 found only two solutions. The reason is that only 3 people were hired to fulfill 6 roles, making the constraints harder to satisfy.\n",
    "- Scenario 2 found close to ten solutions. The reason is that Juan is now Ciara's partner, and both must be part of the hired team. Now, the constraints are much easier to satisfy, as there are 5 abilities left to be distributed among 4 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Most algorithms for solving CSPs search systematically through the possible assignments of values to variables. These algorithms are goint to find a solution, if one exists, or to prove that the problem is unsatisfiable. (Brailsford, Potts & Smith, 1999)\n",
    "\n",
    "CSPs are a powerful abstract model for representing and solving many real-world problems in various fields such as scheduling, planning, resource allocation, configuration, and spatial reasoning. They offer a structured way to break down complex problems into manageable components (variables, domains, and constraints) and apply systematic methods to find solutions."

    "### Integer Linear Programming (ILP)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is a type of mathematical optimization or feasibility program used to find the best solution out of a set of possible solutions. In ILP:\n",
    "- Variables are restricted to be integers.\n",
    "- The objective is often to minimize or maximize some linear function of those integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of divisibility, which limits decision variables to noninteger values, is the main drawback of linear programming. However, in several real-world situations, decision variables needs to have integer values such as assigning people, machines, or vehicles to activities. (Hillier & Lieberman, 2010)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ILP algorithm finds every feasible unique solution by use of a unique twist on iterative integer linear programming: solution blocking. It uses integer constraints (binary variables for assignments and hiring) along with linear programming techniques for optimization (minimizing the number of hired people), and iteratively adds constraints to fully explore the solution space. When addressing issues involving resource allocation and operations research, where specific goals must be optimized within predetermined parameters, this kind of problem-solving is most prevalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How ILP Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Definition:**  A decision point is represented by each variable. For instance, a variable may indicate whether a person is assigned to a specific job in a resource allocation problem (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:** Setting requirements that all solutions must adhere to is necessary for ILP. These can ensure that resources aren't over-allocated, and that only feasible solutions are considered.\n",
    "Typical restrictions include making sure the right amount of roles are filled or that no one is put in a role that isn't a good fit for them based on their abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function:** What you want to optimize is the objective function, which might be anything like maximizing efficiency or lowering expenses. Sometimes, the goal could be as simple as identifying any feasible solution that satisfies the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of ILP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimality:** ILP can provide the best possible solution according to the objective function and within the constraints.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** It can deal with a broad range of problem types, including complex and large-scale problems.\n",
    "- **Universality:** ILP models are broadly applicable in numerous fields such as scheduling, resource allocation, budgeting, etc. (Hillier & Lieberman, 2010)\n",

    "The inconsistency of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) algorithms in solving integer problems represents a notable drawback. While theoretical demonstrations assert these algorithms' convergence within a finite number of iterations, practical implementation on computers can yield a different experience. As such, it's important to consider these computational limitations and the potential for inconsistency when examining and applying ILP algorithms.(Taha, 2017)."
